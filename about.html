        <h1>About the Animation Player</h1>
        <p><strong>This is an in-page player for frame-based animation.</strong></p>
        <h2 id="instructions">How To Use</h2>
        <h3>Start and Stop</h3>
        <p>Click the &quot;Play&quot; button to start the animation. The Play Button will change to a &quot;Pause&quot; button, which you can use to stop it.</p>
        <h3>Moving within the animation</h3>
        <p>You can move forward or backward one frame at a time using the inner arrows next to the progress bar.</p>
        <p>The outer arrows allow you to go to the beginning or the end.</p>
        <p>You can click (and drag) on a spot in the progress bar to move to that point in the animation.</p>
        <h3>Advanced Options</h3>
        <p>Use the &quot;Direction&quot; drop-down to set whether to play forward or backwards.</p>
        <p>Use the &quot;Speed&quot; drop-down to set the speed of the animation - the delay between frames.</p>
        <h3>Closing</h3>
        <p>To collapse the animation window, press the &quot;Close&quot; button in the upper-right-hand corner of the frame.</p>
