This is a small script to display stop-motion animations (in the form of 512x342px images). The player can be embedded into a webpage and slides open when clicking a link.

I wrote this to teach myself some JavaScript when I was a freshman in high school.

End-user documentation is in about.html. Some embedding instructions are in player.js, but the example in index.html may be more useful.
